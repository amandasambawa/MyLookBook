Welcome to the Spring TechStar 2017 Project.

Project Description:

My Lookbook is a new discovery-centric experience that allows users to design outfits for sharing with friends. The user can design outfits by dragging and dropping items from the Macys catalog into a canvas. The user can share their outfits with friends or with other app users.

This proof of concept was created by the 2017 Spring Tech Stars.

Hypothesis:

We Believe that customers want an online experience that allows for creativity and social interaction

So, if we allow customers to design outfits in a tactile and visual way

Then they will use the app for frequently and Macy's will be top of mind when they need to make a purchase.
